# Enigma_Maschine

A working Enigma Machine replica made by Python. #Python 3.*

I tried to make it looks like a real Enigma Machine as much as possible, so there're parts like keyboard, plugboard, rotors, lampboard and stuff.

You can generate sets of random(-ish) plugboard and rotors using pseudo-random seed, and then configue their settings.

FYI, people already broke Enigma code like 70 years ago, so don't use this thing on crypting anything important, just for time-killing and curiosity-satisfying. I take no responsiblity of any kind bad outcome.

I made this during my unemployment and boredness, and this is my very first actually-does-something Python project. There're lot's of WET code, and I can't managed to figure out how to use Class properly yet, 'cause I'm a totally noob. 

But WTH, this thing works like a charm (to me).
